Follwing alowng with this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk&ab_channel=ClearCode

A project to refamiliarize myself with Python syntax and for the fun of building a game.

## To Play:
Either:
1. Open your favorite IDE and run `main.py` or...
2. In the terminal run `python main.py`

### Controls:
[space_bar]

### Object:
Avoid the bugs

## Things I would do if I were to expand on this:
1. Add Scoreboard for best scores
2. Add levels of dificulty
3. Change scoring mechanism from time based to obstacle based
4. Add bonus items
5. Add lives
6. Add health-packs
